//! Running a three-role kernel on one Tensix tile.
//!
//! Stage the operands, stage each role's program in its slot
//! (`tt_isa::mailbox::PROGRAM_REGION`), start the three role images, wait for
//! all three to report `DONE`, and read back what was asked for.
//!
//! # Two schedules
//!
//! [`Schedule::InOrder`] runs unpack, then math, then pack, each to completion.
//! It needs no synchronisation and is enough for a kernel whose unpacker never
//! gets more than the two `Src` banks ahead.
//!
//! [`Schedule::Concurrent`] is what everything bigger needs. A setup program on
//! thread 0 zeroes the `Dst` rows that will be dumped and initialises the
//! kernel's semaphores; *then* all three roles are released by one write to
//! `SOFT_RESET_0` (`Device::load_and_start_together`). Both halves of that are
//! load-bearing:
//!
//! * A semaphore outlives the program that last used it on silicon, so a
//!   consumer released alongside its own `SEMINIT` could read a stale value
//!   first.
//! * Released one by one, each after loading its image, the first roles of a
//!   short kernel finish before the last has started -- a sequential run by
//!   another name, which hid a missing hand-off on silicon that ttsim showed at
//!   once (divergence row 53).
