//! Loops in a role program, lowered to the frontend's expanders.
//!
//! A role's runner pushes every word of its program, at ~2.8 cycles a word
//! (`silicon_perf::role_push_rate`), and a matmul's unpack and math roles push
//! no faster than that: the kernel's pace is its word count. The frontend has
//! two expanders that turn a few pushed words into many instructions
//! (`tt_isa::frontend`): the Replay Expander, which records up to 32
//! instructions and replays them for one `REPLAY` word; and before it the MOP
//! Expander, which turns one `MOP` into a loop of the instructions in the
//! thread's `MopCfg` -- which may themselves be `REPLAY`s, so one `MOP`
//! repeats an arbitrary recorded body.
//!
//! A program states its loops as [`Item::Repeat`]; [`lower`] picks each one's
//! form and says which it picked and why ([`Lowered::loops`]):
//!
//! * a body of at most [`tt_isa::frontend::REPLAY_BUFFER`] instructions, none
//!   of them a `REPLAY` or `MOP`, is recorded once (executing as it records)
//!   and replayed: one word for each further iteration;
//! * the loop that saves the most words beyond that -- and every other loop
//!   with the same body -- takes the thread's one MOP configuration ([`crate::runtime::Kernel::mop`]: one per thread per run):
//!   template 0 with `A0` the body's `REPLAY`, the iteration count in the
//!   `MOP` itself, so two words stand for up to 32 iterations (the mask's
//!   width; `Count1` reaches 128, but past 32 the expander would read mask
//!   bits shifted in, which no gate has measured yet);
//! * anything else is unrolled.
//!
//! The replay buffer is per-thread state the planner owns while a loop runs:
//! a program that uses `REPLAY` itself (the SFPU builder's row loops) is
//! lowered without it, every loop unrolled, since the planner cannot know
//! which of the buffer's slots that program relies on.
//!
//! The claim, held by [`frontend_stream`] in the tests and the gates: the
//! instructions the backend receives from the lowered program are exactly the
//! unrolled program's, word for word.
