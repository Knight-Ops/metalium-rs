//! Running simulator work in a forked child, so that a fatal error is reportable.

//! `libttsim` terminates the process on any contract violation. Without isolation
//! that means the test runner disappears mid-run, printing libttsim's message and
//! nothing else — no test name, no backtrace, no indication of which of forty tests
//! was responsible.
//!
//! [`fork_scope`] runs the risky part in a child process. A fatal error kills the
//! child; the parent observes the exit status and turns it into an ordinary
//! assertion failure that names the test.
//!
//! This is the isolation mechanism ttsim's own documentation recommends, and it is
//! also how it suggests reusing expensive setup: initialize once, fork per case.
