//! A safe, singleton-enforcing wrapper over `libttsim.so`.
//!
//! **This crate is a development and test dependency. It must never appear in the
//! dependency graph of a shipped artifact** — CI enforces that with a `cargo tree`
//! check. Binding the simulator does not compromise the native-Rust goal the way
//! an FFI dependency on a production library would, but only as long as it stays
//! out of shipped builds.
//!
//! # Why this wrapper exists
//!
//! `libttsim.so` has two properties that make direct use hazardous:
//!
//! 1. **It is a process-wide singleton** with no context handle. Its state lives in
//!    file-scope globals, it is single-threaded and non-reentrant, and `init` may be
//!    called exactly once per process. `cargo test`'s thread-per-test default would
//!    otherwise corrupt it in ways that look exactly like simulator bugs.
//! 2. **Every contract violation terminates the process** via `_Exit` — no return
//!    code, no unwinding, no destructors, no panic hook. A misaligned access does
//!    not fail, it ends the test run.
//!
//! The answers are [`Simulator`], which can only be obtained once and is neither
//! `Send` nor `Sync`, and [`fork_scope`], which runs a closure in a forked child so
//! that a fatal error becomes a legible test failure rather than a vanished runner.
//!
//! Property (2) is also why [`transport`] validates every access against the
//! simulator's decode map before making the call. By the time a bad address reaches
//! `libttsim`, there is no one left to report it to.
