//! Posted-write fences as API.
//!
//! [`Device::write`], [`Device::l1_write`] and [`Device::write32`] are *posted*:
//! when they return, the bytes have left the CPU, not landed. A read through the
//! same window is the only thing that says they have (a read does not pass a
//! posted write on the same path). That is harmless until another agent -- an
//! Ethernet transfer landing in the same buffer, a mover told to read it, a core
//! released into it -- acts on what the host just wrote. Then the *host's* late
//! write can land after the other agent's, or the other agent can start before it
//! (divergence row AA: 3 failures in 40 runs with no read-back, 6 in 60 with one
//! on the sender only, 0 in 60 with both).
//!
//! These are the writes that carry the rule so a caller cannot forget it. Each
//! issues its posted writes and then **exactly one** read-back, through the same
//! window and the same path as the writes, and returns only after that read has
//! come back:
//!
//! - [`Device::write32_fenced`], [`Device::write_fenced`] and [`FencedWrite`]: the
//!   general path (registers or memory). Addresses and lengths are dword
//!   multiples, because the read-back is one dword and a register may take only
//!   dword accesses; anything else is refused *before any write*.
//! - [`Device::l1_write_fenced`]: the bulk Tensix-L1 path, byte ranges allowed.
//!
//! The read-back is of the dword holding the last byte written -- the widest
//! single location that every earlier write on the path is ordered before. A
//! register that cannot be read, or whose read has side effects, is fenced by a
//! readable word of the same tile instead: [`FencedWrite::fence_at`].
//!
//! Not every write needs this. A write the host follows with a read through the
//! same window before anything else could act on it is already ordered. A hot
//! path whose only observer is a core the host starts *afterwards* stays
//! un-fenced: the start is a later host access, and every silicon gate for those
//! paths passes without a fence (if one ever does not, that is a finding to fence
//! there, not something this API assumes). The fence is for a *concurrent*
//! observer that needs no start from the host: an Ethernet transfer landing, a
//! mover told to read the range.
