//! Reading a tile's debug timestamper from the host.
//!
//! `TensixTile/DebugTimestamper.md` (identical to Wormhole's): a 64-bit counter
//! that advances every cycle, and an event stream that appends one record to a
//! buffer in L1 per store to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_TIMESTAMP`. The firmware makes the
//! stores (`tt_firmware::corpus`); this configures the buffer, and decodes it.
//!
//! One store per event and no software timestamp read, which is what makes it
//! strictly better than per-core `mcycle` for lining up what three cores did:
//! every event is stamped by the same counter.
