/* Link script for RISCV NC's images (`nc_probe`, and the NC mover).
 *
 * NC's own slot, from its default reset PC 0x12000 to the B mover's list at
 * 0x14000, is 8 KiB: too small for a mover. The image lives instead at
 * `tt_isa::dm::nc::IMAGE_BASE`, the start of `tt_isa::l1::NC_MOVER`, and the
 * host puts a two-instruction jump to it at 0x12000 (`dm::nc::stub`). LENGTH
 * stops at NC's list ring (`dm::nc::IMAGE_MAX`). NC has 8 KiB of local data
 * RAM (`BabyRISCV/README.md:146`).
