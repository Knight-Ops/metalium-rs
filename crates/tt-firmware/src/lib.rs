//! Bare-metal runtime for the Blackhole baby RISC-V cores.
//!
//! # What this runtime does not have
//!
//! * **No `ebreak` on panic.** `ebreak` halts the core and requires an external
//!   agent to resume it, so it cannot back Rust's abort path — a panicking core
//!   would simply stop, indistinguishable from one that never started. Instead
//!   [`panic`] publishes [`status::PANICKED`] and a code to the L1 mailbox, then
//!   spins, so the host can report *why* rather than timing out.
//! * **No `fence.i`.** Zifencei is not implemented and `fence.i` executes as a
//!   `nop`. This runtime never needs it: code is written to L1 before reset is
//!   released, and leaving reset invalidates the instruction cache
//!   (`SoftReset.md:116`). Self-modifying code, or reloading a running core, would
//!   need `RISCV_IC_INVALIDATE_InvalidateAll` in Tensix backend config.
//! * **No core identity at run time.** `mhartid` reads zero on every core and
//!   `misa` lies, so which core this is comes from the link script.
