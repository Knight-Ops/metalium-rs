/* Link script for the RISCV B data mover (`dm_b`).
 *
 * B's entry point is hardwired to L1 offset 0 and it has no reset-PC override
 * (`tt_isa::tensix::Core::B`), so the image lives at 0. LENGTH stops at 0x6000,
 * T0's default reset PC, so the mover and the three role images can all be
 * resident in one tile at once -- a link error, not a clobbered T0 entry point,
 * if it ever grows past that (`tt_isa::dm::IMAGE_MAX`).
