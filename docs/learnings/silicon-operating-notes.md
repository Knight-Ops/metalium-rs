Learned the hard way during Phase 1's silicon bring-up. Three host crashes bought these;
they apply to every phase's silicon gates and low-level hardware interactions.

**Ask the chip what it is, before addressing any Tensix tile.** Harvesting is per-ASIC,
it is invisible on the simulator (divergence row 35), and it cannot be discovered by
probing, because probing a fused-off tile *is* the hang. `Device::tensix_grid` reads
`ENABLED_TENSIX_COL` (ARC telemetry tag 34) and returns a `grid::Tensix`. Not tag 4,
`HARVESTING_STATE`, which is published and empty (row 36).

**The ARC is the one tile you can address before you know anything.** It sits at raw
`(8, 0)`, and `NoC/Coordinates.md:28-29` gives `Y = 0` and `Y = 1` as the rows where X
translation is not applied — so that coordinate denotes the same tile whether or not
translation is on. Every other coordinate's meaning depends on the translation state you
are trying to read. That invariance is the whole bootstrap; `tt_isa::arc` has a test
pinning `ARC_Y == 0` so it cannot be refactored away.

**The harvesting mask is read by population count, not bit position.**
`NoC/Coordinates.md:54` says fused columns are remapped to *maximal X*, so in translated
space the survivors are a prefix of `grid::TENSIX_COLUMNS` and the count determines the
set. This matters because the raw firmware bit layout is **not** published — UMD documents
its own `HarvestingMasks` as logical indices and says nothing about the word. Measured:
`0xfff` on both cards, contiguous, 12 of 14 columns, harvested at X 15 and 16.
`Tensix::from_enabled_column_mask` refuses a non-contiguous mask rather than guessing,
because the cost of a wrong guess is a dead host, not a failed test.

**Order of operations in `open()` is load-bearing.** Read the grid, *then* assert the gate
tile survives on this ASIC, *then* register `SET_NOC_CLEANUP`, *then* scrub. The cleanup
write is a NoC write to a Tensix tile; registered against a fused-off one it would fire on
every close from then on, including the close that follows the hang.

**Run silicon gates through `cargo xtask silicon`**, which runs one test per process
with an fsync'd log. All tests share one physical card and window allocation is global
card state, so `window_exhaustion_is_an_error_not_a_panic`'s `assert_eq!(held.len(), 201)`
is only true if nothing else holds a window. The simulator hides this by handing out a
fresh chip per call.

**When a run can take the node down, buy forensics first.** A hard kill loses the
journal's last minutes *and* unflushed file data — a linked test binary came back as 9.2 MB
of zeros, and `journalctl`'s last entry predated the real death by over two minutes, which
makes it useless as a time of death. What worked: a phase log `sync`'d after every write,
carrying `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` on each line so a reboot is evidence rather than
inference; and running the suite **one test at a time**, which is what identified the
failing access instead of losing the output with the session.

**`auto_reset_timeout=0` is the debugging posture.** It disables the ARC watchdog
(`wormhole.c:489` treats 0 that way), converting "hung NoC escalates to a chip reset that
drops the PCIe link and kills the host" into "card is wedged, recoverable". It removes the
safety net that recovers a hung chip, so it is for bring-up, not for keeping. The harness
and `cargo xtask silicon` report its value; neither refuses to run. The fix for a hang is
the access that caused it, which is what the next note is.

**A baby RISC-V's local data RAM does not answer the NoC while its core is in soft reset.**
The slow-path aperture (`0xFFB1_4000..0xFFB1_DFFF`) is documented as NoC-reachable
(`BabyRISCV/README.md:148`) and the page says nothing about reset. The first silicon probe of
it wrote all five RAMs on the gate tile with every core held -- the harness's resting state --
and never completed; the host died under it (run log `START` with no `END`, boot `497d5859`).
`tt-exalens`, Tenstorrent's own debugger, never makes that access: its
`ensure_private_memory_access` plants `jal x0, 0`, releases the core, halts it, and only
then touches private memory, and its ELF loader stages private sections in L1 rather than
writing them with the core in reset. `tt-device` now encodes the rule: `Device::read`/`write`
refuse the aperture (`TransportError::Hazard`); `local_ram_read`/`local_ram_write` refuse a
core in reset, wait out the post-release zeroing, bound T-cores to their 4 KiB, and move one
dword per access; `park_core` puts a core in the exalens loop. Unit tests watch each refusal,
and the reset check was watched failing with the check removed.

**Do not run `probe_niu.rs` as a grid oracle.** It opens `Simulator` directly, so it is
structurally simulator-only and *cannot* reach a card — which is fortunate, because
finding "the highest addressable byte at each coordinate" is precisely the sweep that
hangs on a fused-off tile. Its 140 is where the bad constant came from.

**An Ethernet link reporting "not Up on both ends" wants a card reset, not a code
change.** Seen 2026-10-01 on the X 3 cable link (X 13 stayed Up) with Ethernet code
unchanged since Phase 8; after a device reset `silicon_eth_link` was 10/10 and the
two-card sharded golden and the smoke tier passed again.

**Host infrastructure, for whoever inherits this VM.** The cards are passed through with
`viommu=virtio`. Switching to the Intel vIOMMU broke the passed-through NVMe — admin queue
DMA never completed (`nvme nvme0: I/O tag 28 QID 0 timeout` → `Identify Controller failed
(-4)`), with `AMD-Vi ... IO_PAGE_FAULT` on the host, across four boots; reverting fixed it
immediately. A DRAM-less controller doing Host Memory Buffer DMA through an emulated
vIOMMU under VFIO is fragile. Unrelated to the cards, but it cost an hour of
misattribution.
