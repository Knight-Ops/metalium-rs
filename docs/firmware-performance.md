# Firmware performance

This is the reference for how fast the firmware is: the data mover, the
B → T0/T1/T2 path, and E1. After each optimization, run `cargo xtask bench`, update
the Scoreboard rows it moved, and add a line to the Change log.

## How to measure

- `cargo xtask bench` runs every benchmark in release, one per process. It writes
  the results to `target/silicon/bench/<stamp>.{jsonl,md}`.
- **Device-timed by default:**
  - Tensix: the tile's debug timestamper, one counter for B and T0–T2.
  - Ethernet: E1's own `mcycle`, gated alone in `silicon_eth_clock` (ttsim does not
    model it; divergence row 71).
  - *Host* figures use `Instant` and include PCIe.
- **Each figure:** the median of 9 runs after a warm-up. Every benchmark checks
  that its data arrived intact.
- **Code:**
  - `crates/tt-tests/tests/silicon_bench_{memory,path,eth}.rs`
  - Shared helpers and peaks: `crates/tt-tests/src/bench.rs`
- **Conditions:** card 0 (p150a), AICLK 1350 MHz, GDDR6 16000 MT/s × 8 channels.

| Ceiling | Value | Source |
|---|--:|---|
| NoC link, one NIU, one direction | 86.4 GB/s | 64 B flit/cycle × 1350 MHz (`NoC/README.md:64`) |
| GDDR6, one channel | 64 GB/s | 16000 MT/s × 32 pins (x32 per channel is reasoned, not published) |
| GDDR6, card | 512 GB/s | 8 channels |
| Ethernet, one link | 50 GB/s | 400 GbE per Ethernet tile |
| 800G (both links, one QSFP-DD) | 100 GB/s each way | 2 tiles per port |

## Scoreboard

The single-tile mover and the Ethernet wire are near their ceilings. Card-wide
GDDR6 reads reach 84% of the card since the NoC ownership rules (change log,
2026-10-02); card-wide writes and 800G are still far off.

| Target | Now | Of ceiling | Goal |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| GDDR6, one tile, 64 KiB entries | 81.6 GB/s | 94% NoC link | hold |
| GDDR6, one tile, 4 KiB entries | 16.3 GB/s | 26% channel | cut per-entry cost |
| GDDR6 reads, card, 120 tiles | 429 GB/s | 84% | 512 GB/s |
| GDDR6 writes, card, 120 tiles (writes on NoC #1) | 266 GB/s | 52% | 512 GB/s |
| GDDR6 reads + writes, card, 120 tiles (writes on NoC #1) | 343 GB/s | 67% | 512 GB/s |
| Ethernet wire, one link (per-byte slope) | 48–51 GB/s | ~97% | hold |
| 800G, both links streaming | 25.8 GB/s | 26% | 100 GB/s |
| Empty kernel, B → T0–T2 → B (device) | 566 cycles (0.42 µs) | — | lower |
| Device busy, 16 queued 32×256×32 matmuls | 12.6% of wall | — | ~100% |
| Requests that waited under the in-flight cap (120 tiles × 300 × 16 KiB, one channel) | 8762 per run | — | watch: revisit `MAX_IN_FLIGHT` if it binds below the NoC's own limit |

## GDDR6 through the data mover

| One tile, entry size | Read, 1 ch | Read, all ch | Write, all ch |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 KiB | 16.3 GB/s | 16.3 | 14.6 |
| 16 KiB | 62.0 (97% ch) | 63.5 | 57.2 |
| 64 KiB | 62.0 | 81.4 (94% link) | 74.1 |
| 128 KiB | 62.0 | 80.7 | 68.0 |

- **Below 16 KiB the rate is set by the cost per entry, about 339 cycles** (317 at
  the baseline; see the change log). A `WAIT` entry alone costs 136 cycles.
- **One DRAM port now carries a whole channel of writes** (62.9 GB/s at 64 KiB).
  Before static VC 1 one port stopped at about 28.5 GB/s and 128 KiB entries
  fell to 27.5.
- Run 1790971715 (reads) and 1790970443 (writes).

| Tiles at once | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 120 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Reads, card GB/s | 85 | 164 | 296 | 370 | 397 | 404 | 404 | **429** |
| Writes on NoC #0, card GB/s | 76 | 78 | 79 | 83 | 102 | 136 | 150 | 161 |
| Writes on NoC #1, card GB/s | 76 | | 251 | | 293 | | 273 | 266 |
| Reads + writes (NoC #1), card GB/s | 97 | | 322 | | 341 | | 346 | 343 |
| All tiles on one channel, GB/s | 63 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 |
| *Before (reads, run 1790950685)* | *85* | *168* | *318* | *244* | *170* | *161* | *146* | *127* |

Runs 1790970443 and 1790971715.

- **The reads no longer collapse past 4 tiles.** Two changes landed together, and
  they haven't been separated:
  - every request now goes out on static VC 1;
  - port 1 of each channel is now NoC #1's, so NoC #0 traffic that asked for port 1
    goes to CMFW's endpoint instead.
- **Reads belong on NoC #0.** With every tile reading on NoC #1, the card stayed
  at one link's rate: 4 tiles 86 GB/s, 120 tiles 58 (run 1790959226).
  - NoC #1's read data climbs the DRAM column, then runs left along the readers'
    shared row.
- **Writes scale on NoC #1 and not on NoC #0.**
- **Each GDDR endpoint belongs to one NoC** (`tt_isa::dram::DramChannel::owns`):
  - NoC #1 gets port 1; NoC #0 gets ports 0 and 2, including CMFW's.
  - Both NoCs on one endpoint is SYS-1419, which hung card 0 (`ttsim-divergence.md`
    row 73).

### What holds card reads at ~430 GB/s: unfair service, not distance

From `gddr_aggregate_affinity` (runs 1790975421 onward), 120 tiles reading,
each tile's share fixed:

| Placement | Card GB/s |
|---|--:|
| Cycle: every tile rotates over all 8 channels (today) | **429** |
| Column: its half's 4 channels, so no data wraps the torus | 417 |
| Nearest: one channel whose endpoint is at or just above the tile, 15 tiles per channel | 315 |
| Nearest, alternating NoC #0's two endpoints | 216 |

- **Distance doesn't explain the gap.** Nearest scored the same 315 GB/s with two
  different row assignments.
- **The finish times do.** Every tile starts within 27 µs of the others, but the
  last finishes up to 966 µs after the first, in a 1102 µs run. The NoC serves
  tiles unevenly, so the card total is set by the slowest tiles. Session splits
  ops evenly across tiles, so its ops wait on the slowest tile the same way.
- **A lower in-flight cap evens out the service:**

  | Reads, tiles | 1 | 4 | 16 | 120 |
  |---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
  | Default cap (`MAX_IN_FLIGHT` 128) | 84.7 | 294 | 397 | 420 |
  | Cap 32 | | | | 452 |
  | Cap 16 | | | | 460 |
  | **Cap 8** | 84.6 | **323** | **472** | **471** (92%) |
  | Cap 4 | 72.4 | 254 | 471 | 464 |

- Under cap 8, write mixes stay within noise of the default, except one tile mixing
  reads and writes, about 5% slower.
- **The default since 2026-10-02:** `dm::TILE_IN_FLIGHT_CAP`, set by
  `DataMover::start`. E1 keeps `MAX_IN_FLIGHT`.

**Cap 8 against the default, by entry size** (reads, card-wide GB/s; `AGG_LEN`,
`AGG_CAP`):

| Entry | 1 tile | 16 tiles | 120 tiles |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 KiB | 16.3 → 15.7 | 255 → 245 | 452 → **480** |
| 16 KiB | 64.9 → 62.1 | 420 → **473** | 464 → **496** (97%) |
| 64 KiB | 84.7 → 84.7 | 396 → **471** | 425 → **467** |
| 128 KiB | 84.5 → 84.3 | 370 → **419** | 398 → **437** |

- **Many tiles: cap 8 wins at every size.** 16 KiB entries, one NoC request
  each, come within 3% of the card.
- **One tile: cap 8 loses 3–4% at 4 and 16 KiB.** Eight requests in flight no
  longer quite cover a small read's latency. From 64 KiB up there's no
  difference.
- **Writes: within noise at every size and tile count.**

### RISCV NC's mover costs what B's does

NC runs the same mover image (`dm_nc`). One tile, per entry, `BENCH_MOVER=nc`:

| Entry | B | NC |
|---|--:|--:|
| 4 KiB read | 351.6 cycles | 351.6 |
| 16 KiB read | 363.5 | 363.6 |
| 4 KiB write | 397.4 | 397.3 |
| `WAIT` (256 in a list) | 136.2 | 136.2 |

- **No sign of a smaller NC instruction cache on Blackhole.** On Wormhole NC's
  was a quarter of B's (`riscv-guide-review.md`), but here NC is as fast as B
  at every size.
- **NC can take any share of the moves.**
- **The 4 KiB read is up from 339 cycles** (the cap-8 default; see above).

### What a second mover buys: reads on B, writes on NC

`copy_pipeline` copies GDDR → L1 → GDDR in 64 KiB blocks, double-buffered,
writes on NoC #1, three ways:

- B alone, sequential.
- B alone, pipelined: block k+1's reads go out with block k's writes.
- Split: B reads, NC writes, synchronised by `SIGNAL` / `WAIT_PEER`.

Copy rate in GB/s (each byte read and written once):

| Entries | Scheme | 1 tile | 4 | 16 | 120 |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 KiB | B pipelined | 5.7 | 22.6 | 90 | 171 |
| 4 KiB | **Split** | **9.1** | **36.0** | **143** | 173 |
| 16 KiB | B pipelined | 19.8 | 78.7 | 152 | 164 |
| 16 KiB | **Split** | **26.4** | **84.5** | 156 | 165 |
| 64 KiB | B pipelined | 28.8 | 85.5 | 161 | 164 |
| 64 KiB | Split | 29.7 | 89.9 | 157 | 164 |

- **The split pays where per-entry cost is the limit:** small entries, or few
  tiles busy. 4 KiB copies run 1.6× faster on one to 16 tiles, because each core
  issues half the entries.
- **Large entries:** B alone already overlaps reads and writes by
  software-pipelining, so the second core adds 3–5%.
- **At 120 tiles every scheme meets the card's copy ceiling,** about 165–173
  GB/s each way.
- **Ops that compute:** the further gain is that B blocks on a `KERNEL` entry
  while the roles run, and NC can keep moving meanwhile. Not yet measured: it
  needs the split in `Session`.

### Why card-wide writes stop at about 160 (NoC #0) and 270 (NoC #1) GB/s

**One channel absorbs a full channel of writes from 120 tiles, on either NoC:**
63.9 GB/s, 99.9% (`gddr_aggregate_nocs`, `Mix::OneChannelWrite`). So neither the
GDDR nor one channel's path is the limit. It appears only when all eight channels
are written at once, which points to links the channels share. Inferred from
dimension-order routing (`NoC/RoutingPaths.md`):

- **NoC #0 (X then Y, east then down):**
  - Write data runs east along the writer's row to a DRAM column (raw X 0 or 9),
    then down that column to the endpoint.
  - Channels 0–3 share column 0's downward links and 4–7 share column 9's: about
    2 × 86 GB/s.
  - Four writers in one row also share that row's link: 79 GB/s.
- **NoC #1 (Y then X, up then left):**
  - Write data climbs the writer's own column, then runs left along the endpoint's
    row.
  - NoC #1 owns port 1 only, and port 1 of channel k and channel k+4 sit in the same
    raw row, so eight channels arrive over four rows.
- **Reads are the mirror image:**
  - Their data leaves each DRAM column along its endpoint rows, then fans out down
    the readers' columns.
  - That is why reads scale and writes don't.

| Card writes (64 KiB, cap 8), tiles | 1 | 4 | 16 | 64 | 120 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| NoC #0 | 76 | 79 | 102 | 149 | 161 |
| NoC #1 | 77 | 257 | 296 | 273 | 268 |
| Alternating per entry (`write_noc::ALTERNATE`) | 85 | 146 | 182 | 250 | 263 |

**Port option C: NoC #1 on port 0 for channels 4–7 (`DramChannel::noc1_port`).**
Under tt-metal's assignment (port 1 on every channel) eight channels' NoC #1
writes arrived over four rows. Port 0 of channels 4–7 sits in four other rows and
is never CMFW's endpoint, so now each channel gets its own row:

| Card writes on NoC #1 (64 KiB, cap 8), tiles | 4 | 16 | 64 | 120 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Port 1 everywhere (tt-metal) | 257 | 296 | 273 | 268 |
| **Option C** | **299** | **421** | **382** | **378** |
| Reads on NoC #0 + writes on NoC #1, option C | 312 | 427 | 384 | 396 |

- **Card reads are unchanged:** 469 GB/s at 120 tiles.
- **Every endpoint is still owned by one NoC,** and CMFW's endpoint never sees
  NoC #1. The host reads and writes GDDR through CMFW's endpoint.
- **Stress:** 60 s, then a 10-minute soak (1440 rounds, 127 GiB), on 120 tiles clean.

**Alternating is not additive.** One core issues every request in order, so when
NoC #0's path backs up B stalls on its initiator and stops feeding NoC #1 too. An
independent NoC #1 issuer, NC, would not stall that way. The mode stays available,
but it is not the default.

## Core path: B → T0/T1/T2

| Hop (empty kernel, `null_kernel`) | Cycles |
|---|--:|
| host writes the list → B begins it | ~4250 (3.1 µs, mostly PCIe) |
| B list begin → `KERNEL` entry → kick | 44 + 129 |
| kick → each role wakes | 2–9 |
| **role wakes → starts pushing** (T0/T1/T2) | **171 / 183 / 183** |
| start → last word pushed (empty program) | 75–82 |
| last push → retired → acknowledged | 9–10, then 24–26 |
| last ack → B sees all three → list end | 43 + 41 |

- **Pushing** costs 2.91 cycles per word on every role, after the fixed start. The
  backend retires within 10 cycles of the last push, so the roles are push-bound.
- **The host round trip is 4.25 µs,** of which the device is 0.42.

| Op, one tile (µs) | Host | Device | Gather | Kernel | Scatter | Roles busy |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| matmul 32×256×32 HiFi4 | 108.6 | 14.4 | 10.3 | 2.3 | 1.2 | 14% |
| matmul 128³ HiFi4 | 144.0 | 45.8 | 19.6 | 15.7 | 9.7 | 34% |
| matmul 512³ HiFi4 | 3304 | 2166 | 1060 | 944 | 153 | 43% |
| add, 64 tiles, SFPU | 251.4 | 135.8 | 76.0 | 20.9 | 38.3 | 15% |
| exp, 64 tiles, SFPU | 684.3 | 576.4 | 38.0 | 499.4 | 38.3 | 87% |

- **Roles busy** = the busiest role's program time / device time. Gather, kernel and
  scatter never overlap.
- **Queueing hides nothing:** 16 queued matmuls still cost 114 µs of host time each.

## Ethernet and 800G

Both links are up: X 3 ↔ X 3 and X 13 ↔ X 13.

| One link, 128 KiB transfer | Device | Of 50 GB/s |
|---|--:|--:|
| Staged → landed | 37.9 GB/s | 76% |
| Tensix → Tensix | 18.6 GB/s | 37% |
| Each further byte, staged (slope, 16–128 KiB) | 48–51 GB/s | ~97% |
| Each further byte, Tensix → Tensix | 23 GB/s | 46% |

- **Fixed cost per transfer:** 0.75 µs staged (the record and ack round trip), and
  1.37 µs Tensix → Tensix.
- **E1 is store-and-forward:** NoC read in (1.76 µs for 128 KiB), then the link, then
  the landing wait, then NoC write out (1.88 µs). Nothing overlaps.

| Streams of 32 × 128 KiB | Total (host-timed) | Of ceiling |
|---|--:|--:|
| 1 link, 1 way | 20.0 GB/s | 40% of 50 |
| 1 link, both ways | 27.7 GB/s | 28% of 100 |
| **2 links, 1 way (800G)** | **25.8 GB/s** | **26% of 100** |
| 2 links, both ways | 32.1 GB/s | 16% of 200 |

A send takes 3.46 µs on the device, but each send in a stream takes 6.47 µs. The
difference is the host polling for the ack and posting the next send over PCIe.

## Where the overhead is (ranked)

1. **The host is in every op and every transfer.** About 100 µs of host work per
   matmul, and about 3 µs per Ethernet send.
2. **Card-wide writes reach half the card.** Card-wide reads are at 84% (fixed
   2026-10-02). NC, still held in reset, is the planned NoC #1 writer.
3. **339 cycles per mover entry (317 at the baseline), about 116 of them before
   the NIU is touched.** The read path's hot code is about 3.0 KB.
   - B's instruction cache is 2 KiB on Wormhole; the Blackhole size is not
     documented (`riscv-guide-review.md`).
   - So per-entry cost depends on code layout, not just instruction count.
4. **Nothing overlaps within an op:** gather, compute and scatter run in sequence.
5. **E1 stores and forwards through one staging buffer,** plus a 0.75 µs round trip
   per transfer.
6. **Writes:** one DRAM port tops out at ~28.5 GB/s; 128 KiB entries fall to
   27–33 GB/s.
7. **About 180 cycles per role from wake to first push.**

**Open issues:**

- [x] **8-bit counter hazard (fixed).** The mover's completion wait reads
  `NIU_MST_REQS_OUTSTANDING_ID`, which is 8 bits and wraps at 256 in flight. A list
  or an on-tile record (up to 65536 tiles) could be reported done before its data
  landed.
  - `noc::issue` now caps each transaction ID at `MAX_IN_FLIGHT` = 128
    (`tt_isa::noc::niu::InFlight`).
  - Waits are counted in the mover mailbox (`THROTTLE_STALLS`, `THROTTLE_CYCLES`).
    You can read them with `DataMover::throttle` or `Session::throttle`.
  - A session prints a `session:` warning the first time it sees waits, and again
    each time they double.
  - Benchmarks report the waits per run; traced lists carry a `THROTTLE` event.
  - Tests: `step49_in_flight` (500 requests in one list), and
    `silicon_bench_memory::gddr_in_flight` (300 requests per tile × 120 tiles on
    one channel, which must stay ≤ the channel's ceiling).
- [x] **Single-port writes (fixed by static VC 1).**
  - Before: 128 KiB write entries collapsed to 27–33 GB/s, and 16 KiB single-port
    writes varied from run to run.
  - After every request went to static VC 1, one port holds 62.9 GB/s at 64 KiB
    and 128 KiB (run 1790970443).
  - The single-port write path changed in nothing else: port hint 0 maps to port
    0 on NoC #0.
- [ ] **Not yet measured:**
  - tile-to-tile L1 over the NoC (the mover has no op for it)
  - card 1 (`cargo xtask bench --device all`)

The cap binds only under contention (120-tile reads: 2023 waits per run; one channel: 4235) without lowering throughput. 120 tiles × 300 requests on one channel completes exactly: 48 GB/s, 8762 waits per run |
