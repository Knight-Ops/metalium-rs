# Firmware performance

This is the reference for how fast the firmware is: the data mover, the
B → T0/T1/T2 path, and E1. After each optimization, run `cargo xtask bench`, update
the Scoreboard rows it moved, and add a line to the Change log.

## How to measure

- `cargo xtask bench` runs every benchmark in release, one per process. It writes
  the results to `target/silicon/bench/<stamp>.{jsonl,md}`.
- **Device-timed by default:**
  - Tensix: the tile's debug timestamper, one counter for B and T0–T2.
  - Ethernet: E1's own `mcycle`, gated alone in `silicon_eth_clock` (ttsim does not
    model it; divergence row 71).
  - *Host* figures use `Instant` and include PCIe.
- **Each figure:** the median of 9 runs after a warm-up. Every benchmark checks
  that its data arrived intact.
- **Code:**
  - `crates/tt-tests/tests/silicon_bench_{memory,path,eth}.rs`
  - Shared helpers and peaks: `crates/tt-tests/src/bench.rs`
- **Conditions:** card 0 (p150a), AICLK 1350 MHz, GDDR6 16000 MT/s × 8 channels.

| Ceiling | Value | Source |
|---|--:|---|
| NoC link, one NIU, one direction | 86.4 GB/s | 64 B flit/cycle × 1350 MHz (`NoC/README.md:64`) |
| GDDR6, one channel | 64 GB/s | 16000 MT/s × 32 pins (x32 per channel is reasoned, not published) |
| GDDR6, card | 512 GB/s | 8 channels |
| Ethernet, one link | 50 GB/s | 400 GbE per Ethernet tile |
| 800G (both links, one QSFP-DD) | 100 GB/s each way | 2 tiles per port |

## Scoreboard

The single-tile mover and the Ethernet wire are near their ceilings. The card-wide
GDDR6 total is not, and neither is 800G.

| Target | Now | Of ceiling | Goal |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| GDDR6, one tile, 64 KiB entries | 81.6 GB/s | 94% NoC link | hold |
| GDDR6, one tile, 4 KiB entries | 17.4 GB/s | 27% channel | cut per-entry cost |
| GDDR6, card, best (4 tiles) | 318 GB/s | 62% | 512 GB/s |
| GDDR6, card, 120 tiles | 127 GB/s | 25% | 512 GB/s |
| GDDR6 writes, card | ≤ 84 GB/s | 16% | 512 GB/s |
| Ethernet wire, one link (per-byte slope) | 48–51 GB/s | ~97% | hold |
| 800G, both links streaming | 25.8 GB/s | 26% | 100 GB/s |
| Empty kernel, B → T0–T2 → B (device) | 566 cycles (0.42 µs) | — | lower |
| Device busy, 16 queued 32×256×32 matmuls | 12.6% of wall | — | ~100% |
| Requests that waited under the in-flight cap (120 tiles × 300 × 16 KiB, one channel) | 8762 per run | — | watch: revisit `MAX_IN_FLIGHT` if it binds below the NoC's own limit |

## GDDR6 through the data mover

| One tile, entry size | Read, 1 ch | Read, all ch | Write, all ch |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 KiB | 17.4 GB/s | 17.4 | 17.3 |
| 16 KiB | 62.0 (97% ch) | 67.5 | 67.3 |
| 64 KiB | 62.0 | 81.6 (94% link) | 73.7 |
| 128 KiB | 62.0 | 80.9 | 27.5 |

- **Below 16 KiB the rate is set by the cost per entry, about 317 cycles** (333
  since the in-flight cap; see the change log). Every list of 240 entries takes
  56.3 µs, whatever the size. A `WAIT` entry alone costs 116 cycles (now 120).
- **Writes through one DRAM port stop at about 28.5 GB/s;** across a channel's three
  ports they reach 63.

| Tiles at once | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 120 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Reads, card GB/s | 85 | 168 | **318** | 244 | 170 | 161 | 146 | 127 |
| Writes, card GB/s | 73 | 84 | 83 | 61 | 61 | 72 | 66 | 52 |
| All tiles on one channel, GB/s | 63 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 64 | 47 |

**One channel holds full rate up to 64 tiles, so the GDDR controllers aren't what
collapses.** All this traffic runs on NoC 0, and NC (the core that could use NoC 1)
is held in reset. Look at the NoC first.

## Core path: B → T0/T1/T2

| Hop (empty kernel, `null_kernel`) | Cycles |
|---|--:|
| host writes the list → B begins it | ~4250 (3.1 µs, mostly PCIe) |
| B list begin → `KERNEL` entry → kick | 44 + 129 |
| kick → each role wakes | 2–9 |
| **role wakes → starts pushing** (T0/T1/T2) | **171 / 183 / 183** |
| start → last word pushed (empty program) | 75–82 |
| last push → retired → acknowledged | 9–10, then 24–26 |
| last ack → B sees all three → list end | 43 + 41 |

- **Pushing** costs 2.91 cycles per word on every role, after the fixed start. The
  backend retires within 10 cycles of the last push, so the roles are push-bound.
- **The host round trip is 4.25 µs,** of which the device is 0.42.

| Op, one tile (µs) | Host | Device | Gather | Kernel | Scatter | Roles busy |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| matmul 32×256×32 HiFi4 | 108.6 | 14.4 | 10.3 | 2.3 | 1.2 | 14% |
| matmul 128³ HiFi4 | 144.0 | 45.8 | 19.6 | 15.7 | 9.7 | 34% |
| matmul 512³ HiFi4 | 3304 | 2166 | 1060 | 944 | 153 | 43% |
| add, 64 tiles, SFPU | 251.4 | 135.8 | 76.0 | 20.9 | 38.3 | 15% |
| exp, 64 tiles, SFPU | 684.3 | 576.4 | 38.0 | 499.4 | 38.3 | 87% |

- **Roles busy** = the busiest role's program time / device time. Gather, kernel and
  scatter never overlap.
- **Queueing hides nothing:** 16 queued matmuls still cost 114 µs of host time each.

## Ethernet and 800G

Both links are up: X 3 ↔ X 3 and X 13 ↔ X 13.

| One link, 128 KiB transfer | Device | Of 50 GB/s |
|---|--:|--:|
| Staged → landed | 37.9 GB/s | 76% |
| Tensix → Tensix | 18.6 GB/s | 37% |
| Each further byte, staged (slope, 16–128 KiB) | 48–51 GB/s | ~97% |
| Each further byte, Tensix → Tensix | 23 GB/s | 46% |

- **Fixed cost per transfer:** 0.75 µs staged (the record and ack round trip), and
  1.37 µs Tensix → Tensix.
- **E1 is store-and-forward:** NoC read in (1.76 µs for 128 KiB), then the link, then
  the landing wait, then NoC write out (1.88 µs). Nothing overlaps.

| Streams of 32 × 128 KiB | Total (host-timed) | Of ceiling |
|---|--:|--:|
| 1 link, 1 way | 20.0 GB/s | 40% of 50 |
| 1 link, both ways | 27.7 GB/s | 28% of 100 |
| **2 links, 1 way (800G)** | **25.8 GB/s** | **26% of 100** |
| 2 links, both ways | 32.1 GB/s | 16% of 200 |

A send takes 3.46 µs on the device, but each send in a stream takes 6.47 µs. The
difference is the host polling for the ack and posting the next send over PCIe.

## Where the overhead is (ranked)

1. **The host is in every op and every transfer.** About 100 µs of host work per
   matmul, and about 3 µs per Ethernet send.
2. **GDDR6 across the card collapses beyond 4 movers.** All of it is on NoC 0, with
   NC unused.
3. **317 cycles per mover entry (now 333), 116 of them before the NIU is touched.**
   The hot loop already overflows B's 2 KiB instruction cache: the committed code
   was about 3.0 KB. That makes per-entry cost depend on code layout, not just
   instruction count.
4. **Nothing overlaps within an op:** gather, compute and scatter run in sequence.
5. **E1 stores and forwards through one staging buffer,** plus a 0.75 µs round trip
   per transfer.
6. **Writes:** one DRAM port tops out at ~28.5 GB/s; 128 KiB entries fall to
   27–33 GB/s.
7. **About 180 cycles per role from wake to first push.**

**Open issues:**

- [x] **8-bit counter hazard (fixed).** The mover's completion wait reads
  `NIU_MST_REQS_OUTSTANDING_ID`, which is 8 bits and wraps at 256 in flight. A list
  or an on-tile record (up to 65536 tiles) could be reported done before its data
  landed.
  - `noc::issue` now caps each transaction ID at `MAX_IN_FLIGHT` = 128
    (`tt_isa::noc::niu::InFlight`).
  - Waits are counted in the mover mailbox (`THROTTLE_STALLS`, `THROTTLE_CYCLES`).
    You can read them with `DataMover::throttle` or `Session::throttle`.
  - A session prints a `session:` warning the first time it sees waits, and again
    each time they double.
  - Benchmarks report the waits per run; traced lists carry a `THROTTLE` event.
  - Tests: `step49_in_flight` (500 requests in one list), and
    `silicon_bench_memory::gddr_in_flight` (300 requests per tile × 120 tiles on
    one channel, which must stay ≤ the channel's ceiling).
- [ ] **Single-port writes are unexplained.**
  - 128 KiB write entries collapse to 27–33 GB/s.
  - 16 KiB writes through one DRAM port vary from run to run with no change to
    that path: 806, 351 and 521 cycles per entry in runs 1790950685, 1790953809
    and 1790956433. Through three ports they hold steady at 351.
  - Not yet explained.
- [ ] **Not yet measured:**
  - tile-to-tile L1 over the NoC (the mover has no op for it)
  - card 1 (`cargo xtask bench --device all`)

## Change log

Newest first. Run = the `target/silicon/bench/<stamp>` it came from.

| Date | Run | Change | Scoreboard effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-02 | 1790956433 | No arithmetic on B (firmware benchmarks) | Per entry: 4 KiB reads 333 → 328 cycles (baseline 317), `WAIT` 120 → 115 (back to the baseline's 116), 16 KiB unchanged. Card totals, core path, matmul and SFPU device times, Ethernet: within 1%. New: sum over rows on the SFPU, 1 tile 4.7 µs, 64 tiles 87 µs on the device |
| 2026-10-02 | tt-mnist, card 0 | No arithmetic on B: element-wise and the sum over rows on the SFPU only (in-order sum, chunked past 16 row tiles); image gate refuses F instructions | MNIST 1 tile 2.0 → 1.7 ms/step; 8 tiles 1.9–2.0 → 2.2 ms/step (small ops spread thin pay the SFPU kernel's launch, which the old cost model avoided). Golden unchanged |
| 2026-10-02 | 1790953809 | Cap mover NoC requests in flight at 128 per transaction ID (fixes the 8-bit counter wrap); waits counted and reported | Per entry: 4 KiB 317 → 333 cycles, 16 KiB unchanged (357), `WAIT` 116 → 120. Card totals unchanged (reads 319 GB/s at 4 tiles, 129 at 120). The cap binds only under contention (120-tile reads: 2023 waits per run; one channel: 4235) without lowering throughput. 120 tiles × 300 requests on one channel completes exactly: 48 GB/s, 8762 waits per run |
| 2026-10-02 | 1790950685 | Baseline: device-timed benchmarks; trace events in B, T0–T2 and E1 | — |
